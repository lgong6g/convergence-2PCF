# convergence-2PCF
A summary of codes in python used in my master thesis project calculating auto/cross 2PCF of convergence and the following parameter inference using MCMC

There is also a jupyter notebook for computing Fisher analysis.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Files in this folder are measurements from MassiveNuS convergence maps and can be used as an example in demonstrating the computation of data covariance matrix and MCMC parameter inference. However, users should implement different measurements according to their own tasks.
