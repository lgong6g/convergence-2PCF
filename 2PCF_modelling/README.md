# Compute convergence auto/cross 2PCF

In the python script modelling_kappa_2PCF.py, users can compute both auto and cross 2PCF of weak lensing convergence with arbitrary number of source redshifts. 

The computation includes simulation shell-thickness correction and different types of interpolation for the convergence auto/cross power spectrum
